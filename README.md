# ppx-monoid

A syntax extension for OCaml to make building values of monoids
easier. Assumes the existence of two operations in scope for some type
`t`:

    empty : t
    (^^)  : t -> t -> t

`ppx-monoid`, triggered by the PPX extension point `monoid`,
reinterprets the semicolon `;` to mean the monoid operation `^^` and
the unit expression `()` to mean `empty`.

Example:

    let empty = "" and (^^) = (^) in
    begin%monoid
      "hello";
      " ";
      "world"
    end

is translated to:

    let empty = "" and (^^) = (^) in
    "hello" ^^ " " ^^ "world"

It is also possible to use `concat` or `concatenate` instead of
`monoid`:

    let empty = "" and (^^) = (^) in
    begin%concat   (* or 'concatenate' *)
      "hello";
      " ";
      "world"
    end

See the `test/test.ml` file for more examples of usage, and for
examples of how the translation interacts with `if then else` and
`match` expressions.

The main use case for this syntax extension is for writing code that
generates HTML which consists of long sequences of concatenated bits
of HTML.
